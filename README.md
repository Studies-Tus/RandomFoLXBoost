# ðŸŒ½ Maize Yield Prediction App

This project uses a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict maize yield (in tons per hectare) based on key environmental and farming inputs.

Built with **Streamlit**, this app allows users such as farmers, agronomists, and researchers to interactively estimate crop yields based on real-world data.

## ðŸ§  Model Info

The model was trained on a Nigerian maize dataset and fine-tuned using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation.  
Best parameters:
```python
{
  'n_estimators': 200,
  'max_depth': 10,
  'min_samples_split': 2
}
